Running the app on Eclipse

Clone the project into the Eclipse (see how) or download the project and import it on Eclipse.

Install TomCat on your machine (version 8.5 recommended)

Configure the server to run from the Eclipse (see how).
Set the limit 

Add the project onto the server

Go to the project properties and see if TomCat is listed on the targeted runtime and if it's checked

Then take a loot at the Deployment Assembly and verify if the Maven libraries folder is on it.

If everything is ok, you will be able to run the app normally on TomCant.
